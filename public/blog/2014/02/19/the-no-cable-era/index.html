        <p>It&rsquo;s been almost 4 years since I cut cable tv at home. For some, it could sound as if I&rsquo;m being cheap but, the reality is that I&rsquo;m not alone as I keep on finding more and more people that decide to stop paying for cable mostly becuase there is no more a percived benefit from such service.</p>

<h2>The On-demand Content Era</h2>

<p>If I have to admit something what I&rsquo;ve missed from cable tv in these years, maybe certain live sports events, awards ceremonies, season finales, etc. Yet, I&rsquo;ve noticed that many of these events are aired on public tv channels. That in my mind means: not need to pay for a service where a lot of time is spent watching channels that have already free access.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>In most cases, at least in the US, it&rsquo;s not hard to find official streaming services for many cable channels. I believe that media networks have understood that providing content online directly, they regain control over pushing advertising to online viewers.</p>

<p>No more commercials! Definitely that&rsquo;s something that I don&rsquo;t miss at all from cable. I still &ldquo;consume&rdquo; ads but not to the extent that I used to when I had cable TV. Having online media services such as Netflix, Hulu and, XBMC I compleately moved away from being force to see tons of irrelevant advertising &ndash; now I decide how much ads to watch and when to watch it.</p>

<h2>TV for Geeks at Home</h2>

<p>Another reason why I don&rsquo;t pay for cable is because I realized that even if I had 50, 200 or 300 channels available, I would spend 90% of my time watching the same 5 channels. In my case, all of them would be sports related channels. As a side note, one of my biggest quests since comming to the US has been finding good quality <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football">Football</a> channels. I&rsquo;m thankful <a href="http://www.beinsports.tv/">BeIn Sports</a> is taking over.</p>

<p>Looking at many alternatives, a friend of mine pointed me to the <a href="http://xbmc.org">XBMC</a> project which offers a full blown open source media server by which you can also access internet streams.</p>

<p>So I went and bought my first <a href="http://raspberrypi.org">Raspberry PI</a> and then I was able to install and setup the XBMC version that has been ported to this hardware called &ndash; <a href="http://www.raspbmc.com">Raspbmc</a>. Now using XBMC plugins, I&rsquo;m able to access a lot of content on-demand, live streamings from other countries and the best play them direclty to my TV via HDMI.</p>

<p>So far my favorite plugins are:</p>

<ul>
<li>LiveStreams &ndash; I&rsquo;m able to access football worlwide. Checkout <a href="www.pluginsxbmc.com">www.pluginsxbmc.com</a></li>
<li>Bluecop &ndash; Brings the nice HD streaming from ESPN 3 (Tennis opens, woot!)</li>
<li>P2P Stream/AceStreams &ndash; In combination with Livestreams, you could access many HD streams for live sports.</li>
<li>FTV &ndash; I access CBS,NBC, CNBC streamings in the US as well as many public channels</li>
</ul>


<p>All of the above in combination with Netflix, Hulu and soon HBO Go, allow me to have all the content I want, whenever I want. News and world affairs content I access it online as well -TuneIn Radio and Sticher and HackerNews are my best friends.</p>
