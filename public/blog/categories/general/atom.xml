    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started my first <a href="http://oracleradio.blogspot.com">blog</a> 6 years ago, with the objective to share technical information about Oracle development tools in Spanish. A couple of years after creating my Spanish blog I decided to start <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/jruiz">another one</a> in English too.</p>

<p>As a non-native English speaker, blogging helps me to practice my grammar, punctuation, etc; at the same time that provides me with a tool to share with others useful information that every now and then I found during my work, geek life.</p>

<p>In recent months I transitioned to a new job in the mobile cloud space, with a company called Moovweb. Many new challenges and lots of learning can perfectly described my ride so far and there is still more to learn , more to experiment, to contribute and to learn from others.</p>

<p>The views of this blog are entirely personnal feel free to share your comments and any feedback that yo might have.</p>
