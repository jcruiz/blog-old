    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been almost two years since my last post on the blog. I’m in shock how fast the time goes by however, it’s great to come back and start writting again. Also it’s pretty amazing the number of things that I have learned since my last post.</p>

<p>Over the last 2 years I’ve been working on a product called <a href="https://www.moovweb.com/solutions/moovcheckout/">MoovCheckout</a>. As a product manager I feel very fortunate to be part of the founding team that took the vision that checkouts could be productize and turned it into a real product offering that now serves hundreds of thousands checkout sessions and registers millions of dollars in transactions placed from a mobile device. I consider this product, a very special child of mine.

During these time I’ve experienced many of the circumstances that founders face during early stages of a company, with the main difference that we didn’t require venture funding to kick off the project, but intead we have a parent company behind the journey of this product.</p>
