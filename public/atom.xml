<p><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">JIRA</a> is a popular tool for managing software product projects. In my role as Product I’ve been an active user of this tool as well as <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>, <a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/">Pivotal Tracker</a> among others in the last few years and, have found different ways that these tools can be used for organizing our product development cycles. </p>

<p>The tools are only the channel used by the organization to have a central location where the engineering teams tracks product implementation tasks, level of effort, bugs and, escalations. At the same time, the Product team uses the tools to communicate current features that are implemented, prioritize new features, plan out new releases and even define product roadmaps.</p>

<p>But as with any tool, if you don’t proactively maintain the information, it quickly becomes outdated and easily forgotten. In this article I would like to describe how I’ve use JIRA as a Product within the software development lifecycle.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="jira-projects">JIRA Projects</h2>

<p>We created multiple JIRA projects for our product development that serve as layers or filters in which we would catalog all the different asks for the engineering team: from feature requests, to escalations, to bug fixes. We quickly understood that in order to maintain an organized engineering backlog, we needed to protected it at all cost. </p>

<p>For that, the engineering leaders and product team took the responsibility to manage the following buckets as described below:</p>

<h3 id="feature-requests---fr">Feature Requests - FR</h3>
<p><strong>Owner:</strong> Product team</p>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The bucket where the product team receives and manages feature requests, enhancements, documentation issues, etc. After the product team evaluated and defined how to best address a given feature requests. We would either approve the feature request via a story or set of stories that go in the icebox or, we would decline the feature request.
Although we used JIRA,  in reality this project could be managed with a simpler and more friendly tool like Trello. You can get created and use tools that are easy to use by all the parts of the organization.</p>

<h3 id="icebox---ib">Icebox - IB</h3>
<p><strong>Owner:</strong> Product/Engineering</p>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This project was used as a <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban">agile Kanban</a> board. Here,  product and engineering would place upcoming engineering work. Prior to sprint planning, each team made sure that the most important stories based on eachother’s priorities where registered and presented during sprint planning meeting. We had a dedicated column called (next sprint). Once the sprint backlog was defined we move all stories for the new sprint into the <strong>Active Sprint</strong> project.</p>

<h3 id="active-sprint---as">Active Sprint - AS</h3>
<p><strong>Owner:</strong> Product/Engineering</p>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong>  This project can be setup either as a <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum">Scrum board</a> or a Kanban board. It contains the engineering tasks for the current sprint. The team worked to have real expectaions and whatever was in the sprint would gotten finished on the sprint. This particularly is a great exercise to keep a good team morale.</p>

<h3 id="escalations---esc">Escalations - ESC</h3>
<p><strong>Owner:</strong> Product/Engineering leads</p>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The engineering team’s window to the outside world. A project used by everyone in the organization to register things that were “urgent” or that required attention from engineering. The product team and engineering leaders would triage the issues and requests. 
As part of the triage the owner would either gather more information, or create an escalation that could go directly into the current sprint (AS project) to be addressed immediately or go into the icebox (IB) to be consider for a future sprint.</p>

<h3 id="final-remarks">Final Remarks</h3>
<p>Remember that JIRA allows you to do bulk changes, which come really handy when moving things from project to project. Also, keep common guidelines that help to maintain consistency across multiple JIRA projects. For example: same components set, common labels, notation, etc.</p>

<p>And last but not least, <strong>purge your icebox</strong> often. It’s super easy to put things in but really hard to get them out. At the end everything will look as it’s important.</p>

<p>I was not able to install Ruby at first becuase Homebrew was not installing and required a separate installation. The sympthoms were:</p>

<p>What gave me a more clear indication that something was missing was when I attempted to install Homebrew by itself</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

<p>With more digging around, I found this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22776751/installing-rvm-requirements-installation-failed-with-status-1">post</a> at StackOverflow where basically explained it was because I never executed Xcode on this machine before, so I had to manually open it one time which kicked off the installation of additional components. Onces that finished I was able to install Homebrew and I executed brew doctor</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">brew doctor</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>After that I hit another roadblock during the installation of Ruby 1.9.3</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span><span class="line">If you meant to cross compile, use `--host'.
</span><span class="line">See `config.log' for more details
</span><span class="line">There has been an error while running configure. Halting the installation.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Found the issue again and basically I needed to install more xcode dependencies. I did it by executing</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">xcode-select --install</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>After all of that I decided to upgrade the Ruby version used by Octopress to version 2.2.0. To do that I edit the version of ruby in the following files:</p>

<pre><code>.rbenv-version
.ruby-version
Gemfile
</code></pre>

<p>Last I got a warning about htmltags in liquid that basically can be solved by upgrading liquid to version. 2.6.2. I changed the version in the Gemfile.lock and Gemfile and executed </p>

<pre><code>bundle install
</code></pre>

    <id>http://jcruiz.co/blog/2015/02/26/2014-the-year-of-scrum-dot-dot-dot</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been a while since my last post. With Q1 almost over, it was long overdue to have a new post out the door by now. I originally started this post at the end of 2014, but finally I was able to make the space to complete it and finally publish it.</p>

<p>2014 was a really interesting and enlightening year for my product management career.  It marked the year that I got fully exposed to the rollout of <a href="http:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29">Scrum</a> at the organization that I currently work on, we started from scratch and now, a year later I realize how much progress we’ve made and how much it has helped me and my team to define good practices and processes on how we built software.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="why-did-we-chose-scrum">Why did we chose Scrum?</h2>
<p>After going through a tortuous project of re-architecting some of the major building blocks from our Platform, we touched bottom. Many things factored-in to make the perfect storm which had a big impact on the team’s morale and left us with many things that needed to be fixed at the end because the ask was too big.</p>

<p>One of my colleagues and good friend had prior experience with Scrum, he became the internal champion of Scrum and soon after our first scrum master. He made sure that not just the team and management were on board with the idea, but also, he made sure that we didn’t take the “easy” and short way of doing Scrum without the proper training. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Lesson No.1: Don’t take shortcuts, a lot of companies start with the wrong foot, yet by the time they realize, it’s already too late</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>By the time we had training, the team was familiar with some of the basics principles from Scrum and even have had some <a href="https://www.scrum.org/scrumbut">“Scrum but”</a> sprints already. That in fact, helped us to make the most out of the training. But same as with the school, one thing is the theory and one thing is the practice…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Lesson No.2: Do the homework before defining processess, test the waters and take formal training. Come prepare and ask as many questions as possible</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="what-has-happened-a-year-later">What has happened a year later?</h2>
<p>In the same way that the whole process started organically, we as team started adapting Scrum to our organization, making all kinds of adjustments like: sprint duration, estimation, story points, how we run demos and retrospectives, definition of done, managing escalations…, and the list goes on and on.</p>

<p>Up until know we have what I consider a good practice that is the sum of all the different adjustments, some of which I mentioned above and that will always require to keep evolving. </p>

<p>The major aspects from our current Sprint process circle around the respect for the engineer’s time and the high cost associated with switching contexts. It puts a big responsibility on Product to make all the necessary due diligence required to define, scope and prioritize what goes into a Sprint. It’s build on transparency, knowledge sharing and keeping honest to ourselves acknowledging the areas of improvement and taking actions to correct what is going in the wrong direction and, excel those things that we are doing well so we can continue doing them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Lesson No.3 There has to be a continuous improvement on processes and methods that lead to better results and higher team morale</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="what-are-the-major-challenges">What are the major challenges</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Releasing often and maintain momentum over features</li>
  <li>On Product: Keep a healthy backlog and prioritize in the best possible way in an ocean of requirements (<em>see this article: http://www.forbes.com/sites/kylewong/2015/02/13/your-startup-is-overwhelmed-with-product-requests-now-what/</em>)</li>
  <li>Pruning the icebox</li>
  <li>People over processes </li>
  <li>Develop further the role of the scrum master</li>
  <li>Releasing usable software</li>
  <li>Identifying the ROI associated with features</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="my-list-of-benefits-from-scrum">My list of Benefits from Scrum</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Streamlined and organized product development cycle</li>
  <li>Shared knowledge</li>
  <li>Clear definition of roles, </li>
  <li>Clear distinction of functions engineering vs product</li>
  <li>Constant collaboration</li>
  <li>Constant feedback recollection</li>
  <li>The art of prioritization</li>
  <li>Mastering JIRA</li>
  <li>Easier communication with other parts from the organization</li>
  <li>Getting things done</li>
  <li>Move the needle forward. </li>
</ul>

<p>Expect more shared opinions from the journey into the Product Management waters. </p>

    <link href="http://jcruiz.co/blog/2014/09/28/the-new-era-of-colombian-innovators-is-here/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-28T22:34:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jcruiz.co/blog/2014/09/28/the-new-era-of-colombian-innovators-is-here</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Byqgbw4IcAAltGw.jpg" alt="courtesy of @SWCol" />
In recent weeks I’ve virtually followed 2 StartupWeekend events that took place in Bogota, Colombia that gave me a general ideal about the growth of the innovation ecosystem in the country and the new blood of entrepreneurs. </p>

<p>I noticed something that is establishing as a strong and valid alternative that attracts young generations to come up with a fearless attitude and bring fresh and new ideas to improve the way things work in the country/city/communities. In this article I’m going to offer my negative and positive impressions together with resources that are useful for anyone that wants to followup on this.<br />
<!--more-->
###Event 1: StartupWeekend Uniandes
I found out about a <a href="http://uniandes.startupweekend.org/">startup-weekend Uniandes</a> event that took place at the no.1 ranked school in the country. And I was positive surprise that they had a live stream.</p>

<p>My main goal was to get a sense of the dynamics and quality of the projects/mentors/judges to compare it against the events that is normal to see all the time in the silicon valley.
###Event 2: StartupWeekend Fashion Tech
Having a more defined objective into exploring the challenges and ideas presented on a fields like eCommerce which I’ve been exposed while working at Moovweb. This in combination with a very developed and strong fashion industry in Colombia attracted me to also follow this event via streaming.
####What I liked?
<strong>Organization:</strong> I was positively impressed on how well the events were organized. Bringing together participants, mentors, sponsors and judges during a full weekend event is not an easy tasks. And on top of that, opening up the events for people that couldn’t not make it in person via streaming was fantastic.
<strong>Ideas:</strong> A lot of new and interesting initiatives were explored, also with the guidance of the mentors the refinement between where it starts and what gets presented to the judges is actually, in the majority of the cases, something that is well scoped.
<strong>Open communication:</strong> Not just among mentors, participants and organizers, but also I, as remote attendee had the opportunity to interact with many people via twitter and send feedback almost in real time as if I was there.
<strong>Social conscience:</strong> Colombia’s own reality and timing is crucial, we are entering to an era where peace in the nation seems like a viable solution. Though this brings many challenges for the civil society. I really like to see a few mentors trying to push the participants towards generating ideas that contribute with social ideas instead of the “social garbage”. There is a big opportunity for innovation and something that is unique to the innovation environment in Colombia.
####Things that need improvement
<strong>Presentation skills:</strong> Something that really makes a difference on pitching an idea is the presentation skills. Generally speaking the in the US people start building this skills at very early stages in life. As opposed to in the last minute and without much form.
<strong>Sponsors:</strong> There not enough exposition/involvement of sponsors to these events. The judges are good but, involving the industry and companies that would benefit from the amazing ideas that this young people are creating is a great business opportunity. I noticed the same as I was in college: the gap between the schools and the market is big in countries like Colombia.
<strong>Wider exposure:</strong> In some cases I could see that companies and ideas focused on a really small subset of competitors in ideas that are already in the market. Pushing the local entrepreneurs to know the space and know it well has to be a measure of success.
<strong>Large groups:</strong> Many of the groups seems really big,. It’s hard to start something or give continuity having too many people to coordinate with.</p>

<p>Coincidencially at the time of writing this article I bumped into this article on LinkedIn called <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20140822204819-17275377-a-call-for-early-stage-investment-in-colombia">A call for early stage investment in Colombia</a> that touches in many of the aspects that I mentioned in this article.</p>

    <link href="http://jcruiz.co/blog/2014/08/22/a-new-theme-for-the-blog/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-22T23:42:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jcruiz.co/blog/2014/08/22/a-new-theme-for-the-blog</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week I started looking at how to modify or replace the “classic” theme that comes off-the-shelf with Octopress. I was positively surprised when I found the glorious <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes">3rd party Octopress themes</a>. I took the time to check most of them and it was great to see a consistent high-quality around most of them. Also, how easy it was to add them into the blog. On top of that, I added a few experimental performance settings to speed up the blog using the limited free infrastructure. Read on to get more details.
<!--more--></p>

<p>The theme that I liked the most (which is the one that you are looking at right now) is called <a href="http://https://github.com/sevenadrian/MediumFox">MediumFox</a>, created by Adrian Artiles. It’sinspired on the design of Medium and FoxSlide.</p>

<p>Besides being fully responsive, it contains really nice visual design: from the picture to the font, as well as the top bio which is a great way to present the blog to new visitors.</p>

<p>When installing Octopress themes I recommend that you install them using git submodules, this way everytime you deploy the blog to your server, it will pull the latest changes to the theme by free which is really good.</p>

<p>Another improvement that I added to the blog, was changing the default ruby web server that octopress uses locally which is the sames that Heroku uses when deployment-called WEBrick.</p>

<p>After installing the theme I received a console message from Heroku advicing changing the web server to <a href="http://unicorn.bogomips.org/">Unicorn</a>. The interesting part about unicorn is the fact that using a single Dyno (heroku’s processor), with Unicorn you can have up to 4 workers in pararell in comparison with a single worker that WEBrick offers. Heroky has some really nice instructions about how to add unicorn to your Ruby application <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rails-unicorn">here</a></p>

<p>Although the blog didn’t have any performance issues that I’m aware off, this I consider it my personal playground and I’ll continue adding things as I’m learning about them.</p>

<p>Durante algunas semanas tuve la oportunidad maravillosa de disfrutar de la copa del mundo en distintas ciudades a lo largo de Brasil, ya una vez de regreso al valle de silicio, comparto algunas impresiones que me dejó esta copa dejando de un lado el tema deportivo y enfocándose en el potencial que tiene Brasil para continuar evolucionando a la par de los que consideramos los “mejores” países.</p>

<p>La copa del mundo estuvo precedida de dificultades, polémicas, escándalos y se generó la expectativa de  un fracaso anunciado. Desde mi perspectiva Brasil y los brasileños lograron llevar a cabo una de las mejores copas de la historia en lo que a fútbol se refiere dentro de un ambiente de fiesta y alegría única característica del pueblo brasileño. A la altura de cualquier otro país que está en vía de desarrollo.</p>

<p>Quedo demostrado el enorme potencial que Brasil tiene para competir a la par de cualquier otro país y este nivel de competitividad se puede desarrollar en cualquier campo - no solo en el ámbito de los deportes.Brasil cuenta ya con muchas aspectos fundamentales de competitividad: infraestructura en las ciudades, buenas vías terrestres, puertos marítimos, internet de alta velocidad, aeropuertos que conectan todos los puntos del país y con el exterior, etc. </p>

<p>Así mismo Brasil está experimentando una explosión tecnológica que toca todos los sectores de la sociedad, los brasileños son naturales para las redes sociales y el mundo móvil está transformando la forma en que se acceden y utilizan servicios a nivel local y nacional.</p>

<p>No soy un experto en los problemas de fondo que enfrenta Brasil, sin embargo noto muchas similitudes con relación a mi país Colombia así como otros de la región. Allí la cultura no se enfoca en innovar con calidad, por el contrario siempre se espera que algo no funcione de la forma en que debería funcionar desde el principio y esto es aceptado, se cree que lo de afuera es mejor y tiene mejor calidad y creemos que por estar en América del Sur no tenemos las mismas oportunidades.</p>

<p>Las barreras están en nuestra mente y en nuestra cultura - apostemos al buen trabajo, al trabajo de calidad y a aprender a innovar. Esto no para copiar sino para aprovechar las ventajas que tenemos hoy en día, donde las fronteras ya no existen y estamos rodeados de  una avalancha de información por todos lados. Así como los equipos de la copa del mundo, trabajemos en equipo hacia objetivos en común y dejemos de un lado el pensar únicamente en el bien individual, cuando está en nosotros el forjar el futuro de nuestro país.</p>

    <id>http://jcruiz.co/blog/2014/03/26/ruby-rvms-and-mac-os-x-update2-mavericks-issues</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I use <a href="http://rvm.io/">RVMs</a> to run ruby applications such as this blog and @Moovweb’s pre-release software built via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems">ruby gems</a>. </p>

<p>A friend of mine and I are going to try to work on a Rails application, which is a good opportunity for me to understand the technology behind so many apps nowadays. </p>

<p>As I was getting my environment ready, I ran in some issues on a couple of computers that I had recently updated to Mavericks update 2, this is what happened. I advice that you read the end of this post first… trust me.

The first symthom is when you try to install a RVM version and you get messages of this type:</p>

<pre><code>ruby-2.0.0-p247 - #installing.................................................................................................................................
Retrieving rubygems-2.1.11
There is no checksum for 'http://production.cf.rubygems.org/rubygems/rubygems-2.1.11.tgz' or 'rubygems-2.1.11.tgz', it's not possible to validate it.
This could be because your RVM install's list of versions is out of date. You may want to
update your list of rubies by running 'rvm get stable' and try again.
If that does not resolve the issue and you wish to continue with unverified download
add '--verify-downloads 1' after the command.

There has been an error while trying to fetch rubygems.
Halting the installation.
</code></pre>

<p>Even if you get this error, it seems that the installation was successful. Now I tried to run a rails command:</p>

<pre><code>$ rails console
Could not find rake-10.1.1 in any of the sources
Run `bundle install` to install missing gems.
</code></pre>

<p>So then I follow the instruction:</p>

<pre><code>$ bundle install
</code></pre>

<p>And bump into the error:</p>

<pre><code>Gem::Installer::ExtensionBuildError: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

<p>So after looking around, I discover that pg stands for <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">postgresql</a> so then it was suggested that I could installed using <a href="http://brew.sh">brew</a>. The plan of attack was to manage to install all of the above to then re-run the bundle install.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this attempt also failed, after running bundle install again, I got.</p>

<p>This story ends bad. After my many attempts, I ended up removing all rvms from my system and then re-installing everything again. I believe that after update symbolic links got removed. If you have had a similar experience or found a better workaround please leave a comment.</p>

    <link href="http://jcruiz.co/blog/2014/03/02/traveling-to-bogota-here-are-my-recommendations-part-1/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-02T17:06:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://jcruiz.co/blog/2014/03/02/traveling-to-bogota-here-are-my-recommendations-part-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been asked in various occasions for recommendations and tips when traveling to Colombia. The people that know me, are aware that I talk a lot about Colombia and about my life growing in Bogota. </p>

<p>Conversations about Colombia, often end up in someone knowing someone that have been to Colombia or is planning to go to Colombia. And often, I end up volunteering to provide tips, guidance to get what I consider, an awesome experience while in my Country.</p>

<p>So instead of continuing sending out individual messages with recommendations about Colombia, why not posting them out there in the Internet so other could potentially find them? So here they are, let’s start with my city: Bogota
<!--more-->
Bogota is a very large city that much like any other major city in the world like NYC, Paris or Sao Paulo is live 24x7. These days the traffic has been really bad so be prepared to spend time in traffic jams, so avoid as much as you can to move around during peak times. 7 - 9 a.m in the mornings and 4-7 at night.</p>

<p>If you have a smarthphone with an active data plan on your phone. I encourage you to download <a href="http://tappsi.co/">Tappsi</a>, so you can order taxis in a similar way to Lift or Uber in a secure and confortable way. Also, <a href="https://www.uber.com/cities/bogota">Uber</a> is active in Bogota and the prices similar to the US.</p>

<p>I’m going to start covering those areas in the city that are located in the northen part:</p>

<h3 id="usaquen">Usaquen</h3>
<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">What used to be a small town located in the outskirts of the city, it&#8217;s now a neighborhood. Though it is one of the most vibrant areas where you can find great restaurants and bars. You could literally try different things in every visit.</p>
<p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/juanchoruiz/blog/usaquen_zpsbfe09de2.jpg" /></p>

<p>Recommendations:<br />
Usaquen has a famous flea market on Sundays where you can experience the great diversity of Bogota and buy really good handcrafts and souvenirs. Also right next to Usaquen there is a nice shopping mall-Hacienda Santa Barbara.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Antara: Peruvian food.</li>
  <li>80 sillas: Fusion international.</li>
  <li>Abasto: Organic/colombian food, great for brunch.</li>
  <li>Bogota Beer company: Drinks, social fun times.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="parque-93">Parque 93</h3>
<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">A park in the north that is surrounded by nice bars and restaurants. A great place to go for dinner + drinks/party</p>
<p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/juanchoruiz/blog/93_zps71f8cfa8.jpg" /></p>

<p>Recommendations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Salto del Angel: Dinner + party</li>
  <li>Sagal: Steak house</li>
  <li>Bogota Beer company</li>
  <li>Wok: Asian fusion</li>
  <li>La Hamburgueseria: Burgers + live music</li>
  <li>El corral: If you like hamburgers, you <strong>HAVE TO</strong> try El Corral, the best burgers in the world</li>
  <li>La bonga del sinu: Colombian style stake house</li>
  <li>Kukaramakara: Party</li>
  <li>Gaira Cafe: Northern Colombian food + party</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="zona-t">Zona T</h3>
<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Is Bogota&#8217;s version of San Francisco&#8217;s Union Square. Upscale shopping + tons of alternatives to eat and party</p>
<p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/juanchoruiz/blog/zonaT_zps0aaf280e.jpg" /></p>

<p>Recommendations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>La Plaza de Andres: Great food from all over Colombia</li>
  <li>14 Incas: Peruvian</li>
  <li>La mona: After-party food</li>
  <li>Andres DC: One of the best parties in the city you can get food there as well</li>
  <li>Cachao: Mojitos + live salsa</li>
  <li>Brasserie: French</li>
  <li>Armando Records: Alternative music, live bands, party</li>
  <li>Club Colombia: Upscale colombian food</li>
  <li>Wabisabi: Japanese</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="zona-g">Zona G</h3>
<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Established as one of the fastest growing areas for new and upscale restaurants in the city.</p>
<p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/juanchoruiz/blog/zonag_zps890c7f10.jpg" /></p>

<p>Recommendations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Astrid y Gaston: Peruvian</li>

</ul>

    <link href="http://jcruiz.co/blog/2014/02/19/the-no-cable-era/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-19T00:40:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://jcruiz.co/blog/2014/02/19/the-no-cable-era</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been almost 4 years since I cut cable tv at home. For some, it could sound as if I’m being cheap but, the reality is that I’m not alone as I keep on finding more and more people that decide to stop paying for cable mostly becuase there is no more a percived benefit from such service.</p>

<h3 id="the-on-demand-content-era">The On-demand Content Era</h3>
<p>If I have to admit something what I’ve missed from cable tv in these years, maybe certain live sports events, awards ceremonies, season finales, etc. Yet, I’ve noticed that many of these events are aired on public tv channels. That in my mind means: not need to pay for a service where a lot of time is spent watching channels that have already free access.
<!--more-->
In most cases, at least in the US, it’s not hard to find official streaming services for many cable channels. I believe that media networks have understood that providing content online directly, they regain control over pushing advertising to online viewers.</p>

<p>No more commercials! Definitely that’s something that I don’t miss at all from cable. I still “consume” ads but not to the extent that I used to when I had cable TV. Having online media services such as Netflix, Hulu and, XBMC I compleately moved away from being force to see tons of irrelevant advertising - now I decide how much ads to watch and when to watch it.</p>

<h3 id="tv-for-geeks-at-home">TV for Geeks at Home</h3>
<p>Another reason why I don’t pay for cable is because I realized that even if I had 50, 200 or 300 channels available, I would spend 90% of my time watching the same 5 channels. In my case, all of them would be sports related channels. As a side note, one of my biggest quests since comming to the US has been finding good quality <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football">Football</a> channels. I’m thankful <a href="http://www.beinsports.tv/">BeIn Sports</a> is taking over.</p>

<p>Looking at many alternatives, a friend of mine pointed me to the <a href="http://xbmc.org">XBMC</a> project which offers a full blown open source media server by which you can also access internet streams.</p>

<p>So I went and bought my first <a href="http://raspberrypi.org">Raspberry PI</a> and then I was able to install and setup the XBMC version that has been ported to this hardware called - <a href="http://www.raspbmc.com">Raspbmc</a>. Now using XBMC plugins, I’m able to access a lot of content on-demand, live streamings from other countries and the best play them direclty to my TV via HDMI.</p>

<p>So far my favorite plugins are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>LiveStreams - I’m able to access football worlwide. Checkout <a href="www.pluginsxbmc.com">www.pluginsxbmc.com</a></li>
  <li>Bluecop - Brings the nice HD streaming from ESPN 3 (Tennis opens, woot!)</li>
  <li>P2P Stream/AceStreams - In combination with Livestreams, you could access many HD streams for live sports.</li>
  <li>FTV - I access CBS,NBC, CNBC streamings in the US as well as many public channels</li>
  <li>Icefilms - The best way to checkout series and movies via streaming, it’s been one of my favorite ones for sure. <a href="https://code.google.com/p/anarchintosh-projects/">https://code.google.com/p/anarchintosh-projects/</a></li>
  <li>PalcoTV - Although is mostly driven by a Spanish based community, it currently contains a huge number of channels from UK and Russia. This one is currently not updated manually as the community is getting organized around including it on a repo and so on, so you have to manually keep it up to date.<a href="https://github.com/pauron/palcotv-repository">https://github.com/pauron/palcotv-repository</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All of the above in combination with Netflix, Hulu and soon HBO Go, allow me to have all the content I want, whenever I want. News and world affairs content I access it online as well -TuneIn Radio and Sticher and HackerNews are my channels for consuming information, why speding time watching other people’s lives in realities or even watching Fox News?</p>

    <updated>2013-10-03T00:04:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jcruiz.co/blog/2013/10/03/installing-chrome-on-rhel6-dot-3</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facing an interesting task the other day at work. Install <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Google Chrome</a> in a RHEL6.3 machine. This seems like a pretty standard task to be perfomed. </p>

<p>Interesting enough, Google is not longer supporting RedHat-based linux flavors such as CentOS or Fedora. This to me is actually shocking at the same time that compleately puts my engenieering ego in the spot.
<!--more-->
After googling around for hours I managed to get it working. Thank to <a href="http://chrome.richardlloyd.org.uk/">Richar Lloyd</a> and <a href="http://www.tecmint.com/install-google-chrome-on-redhat-centos-fedora-linux/">Narad Shrestha</a>, I was able to see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

<p>So follow up the above link from Naradm, then it will prompt you to upgrade the entire system to a new version in order to run chrome, which really is ridiculous - instead just upgrade nss by doing:</p>

<p><code>yum update nss</code></p>

<p>after that you will be able to execute google-chrome as a non-root user.</p>

<p>Also as a recommendation, enter your RHN credential directly during installation, as this is the only way to get YUM up and running without a problem. Otherwhise you will get stuck trying to run commands in the terminal + searching for the right wizard that allows you to register you machine into the RHN.</p>

<p>Mission accomplished </p>

    <link href="http://jcruiz.co/blog/2013/08/30/blogging-like-a-hacker/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-30T13:30:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jcruiz.co/blog/2013/08/30/blogging-like-a-hacker</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My old blogs used well known blogging engines: blogger and MovableType. For years blogger has been able to keep up with trends - in my opinion always catching up. However, I didn’t want to simply create a new blog on blogger; something was just not right.</p>

<p>One day a technical blog cought my attention because of its look and feel and nice caligraphy. It was <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> which was created under the premise that is a blogging framework for hackers.</p>

<p>So, what does it reallly mean? Let me give you more context info:
<!--more-->
I come from the Java EE world - so IDEs, frameworks, installing appication servers, compiling and running - are all very well known to me. However when I joined <a href="http://moovweb.com">Moovweb</a> I realized something that I had been seeing for a while: the new companies are not sold by Java or .Net anymore.</p>

<p>In other words, outside of the traditional corporate world developers don’t talk anymore about enterprise EJBs, Controllers or JSF, and instead the dictionary words sound something like Go, JavaScript, Ruby, HTML 5, CSS3, Sass, Bootstrap, Angular, etc….</p>

<p>The new era of enterprise software is already here and it is rapidly taking over the traditional way that, not too long ago for some of us, were the latest trends in programming: objects oriented, MVC, JSPs (specially) …. and I thought that at that point I knew it all.</p>

<p>So how all of the above connects with blogging? Well, I just told you about my developer journey and where I’m right now so, the following is my new workflow journey for blogging:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bought a domain so my blog was easy to remember/access.</li>
  <li>Created a <a href="http://heroku.com">heroku</a> account. Heroku allows me to host Ruby applications in the cloud. Also, it supports apps from other languages besides Ruby like Java, Node.js, Python, PHP, Clojure and, Scala.</li>
  <li>Created a <a href="http://cloudflare.com">CloudFlare</a> account that allows me to provide CDN-type features like caching images and content, which in my case is not critical but having perfomance is great.</li>
  <li>I’m learning <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> which gets used for writing the posts. Btw it’s awesome!</li>
  <li>I’m learning to use <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> for source control versioning of my application code and for pushing any changes to the blog to Heroku.</li>
  <li>(Future) learn Sass to add customizations to the blog, <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to add <a href="https://github.com/screeninteraction/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin">internationalization</a> and who knows where this is going to stop…. I hope never.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you have any suggestions on other things that I should try?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started my first <a href="http://oracleradio.blogspot.com">blog</a> 6 years ago, with the objective to share technical information about Oracle development tools in Spanish. A couple of years after that I started <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/jruiz">another one</a> in English too as part of my previous job.</p>

<p>As a non-native English speaker, blogging helps me to practice my grammar, punctuation, etc; I’m a true believer in collective knowledge sharing and how the more knowledge I share, the more knowledge I could gather which is another great thing about blogging.</p>

<p>In recent months I transitioned to a new job in the mobile cloud space, with a company called <a href="http://moovweb.com">Moovweb</a>. Many new challenges and lots of learning can perfectly describe my ride so far and there is still more to learn, more to experiment, to contribute, and to learn from others.</p>

<p>The views of this blog are entirely personnal, feel free to share your comments and any feedback you might have.</p>
