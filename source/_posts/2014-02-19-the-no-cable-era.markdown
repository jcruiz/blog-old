It's been almost 4 years without cable at home. For some, it could sound as if I'm being cheap but the reality is that I keep on finding more and more people that decide to stop paying for cable as we don't really see the benefit from such service.

##The On-demand Content Era
If I have to admit something that I've missed maybe it's some live events that most of the times are aired on the public tv channels. Which means that there is not need to pay for a service where most of the time is spent by watching the channels that are already free.

However, in most cases, at least in the US, it's not hard to find a free official streaming service for the majority of public channels. Media networks have understand that at least by re-gaining control over in the Internet by publishing a free stream - and that is being able to still push advertising through these channels.

No more commercials! Definitely something that don't miss at all, I still "consume" commercials but never to the level that I used to when I had cable TV. After having Netflix, Hulu and XBMC I compleately moved away from being expose to tons of advertising, now I decide what and when to consume advertising.

##TV for Geeks at Home
Another reason why I don't pay for cable is because, I soon realized that even if I had 200, 300 or 50 channels available, 90% of my time I would spend it on the same 5 channels. In my case, those are all sports related channels. But my biggest quest since comming into the US has been to find good quality Football channel.

Looking for many alternatives, a friend of mine pointed me to the [XBMC](http://xbmc.org) project that offers a full blown open source media server, by which you can access content located within a network.

After buying my first [Raspberry PI](http://raspberrypi.org), I was able to install the XBMC version that has been ported to this hardware called - [Raspbmc](http://www.raspbmc.com). Now using the some XBMC plugins, I'm able to access a lot of on-demand content and output it direclty to my TV via HDMI.

So far my favorite plugins are:

+   LiveStreams - I'm able to access football worlwide. Checkout [www.pluginsxbmc.com](www.pluginsxbmc.com)
+   Bluecop - It bring the nice HD streaming from ESPN 3 (Tennis opens, woot!)
+   P2P Stream/AceStreams - In combination with Livestreams, you could access many HD streams for live sports.
+   FTV - I can access CBS,NBC, CNBC streamings in the US as well as many public channels

This in combination with Netflix, Hulu and soon HBO Go allow me to have the content I want, whenever I want. For any news and world affairs Internet both written and listen (TuneIn or Sticher) are my best friends.

Do you still pay for Cable? Why?
