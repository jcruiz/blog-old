I started my first [blog](http://oracleradio.blogspot.com) 6 years ago, with the objective to share technical information about Oracle development tools in Spanish. A couple of years after creating my Spanish blog I decided to start [another one](http://blogs.oracle.com/jruiz) in English too.

As a non-native English speaker, blogging helps me to practice my grammar, punctuation, etc; at the same time that provides me with a tool to share with others useful information that every now and then I found during my work, geek life.

In recent months I transitioned to a new job in the mobile cloud space, with a company called Moovweb. Many new challenges and lots of learning can perfectly described my ride so far and there is still more to learn , more to experiment, to contribute and to learn from others.

The views of this blog are entirely personnal feel free to share your comments and any feedback that yo might have.
