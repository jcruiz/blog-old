I started my first [blog](http://oracleradio.blogspot.com) 6 years ago, with the objective to share technical information about Oracle development tools in Spanish. A couple of years after that I started [another one](http://blogs.oracle.com/jruiz) in English too as part of my previous job.

As a non-native English speaker, blogging helps me to practice my grammar, punctuation, etc; I'm a true believer in collective knowledge sharing and how the more knowledge I share, the more knowledge I could gather which is another great thing about blogging.

In recent months I transitioned to a new job in the mobile cloud space, with a company called [Moovweb](http://moovweb.com). Many new challenges and lots of learning can perfectly describe my ride so far and there is still more to learn, more to experiment, to contribute, and to learn from others.

The views of this blog are entirely personnal, feel free to share your comments and any feedback you might have.
