My old blogs used well known blogging engines: blogger and MovableType. For years blogger has been able to keep up with trends - in my opinion always catching up. However, I didn't want to simply create a new blog on blogger; something was just not right.

One day a technical blog cought my attention because of its look and feel and nice caligraphy. It was [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) which was created under the premise that is a blogging framework for hackers.

So, what does it reallly means? Let me give you more context info:
<!--more-->
I come from the Java EE world - so IDEs, frameworks, installing appication servers, compiling and running - are all very known to me. However when I joined [Moovweb](http://moovweb.com) I realized something that I had been seeing for a while: the new companies are not sold by Java or .Net anymore.

In other words, outside of the traditional corporate world you as a developer, wont be talking anymore about enterprise java beans (EJBs) and java server faces (JSF) and instead, words in your dictionary sound something like Go, JavaScript, Ruby, HTML 5, CSS3, Sass, Bootstrap, Angular, etc....

The new era of enterprise software is already here and it is rapidly taking over the traditional way that, not too long ago for some of us, were the latest trends in programming: objects oriented, MVC, JSPs (specially) .... and I thought that at that point I knew it all.

So how all of the above connects with blogging? Well, I just told you about my developer journey and where I'm right now so, as part of my new life:

* I'm getting use to not having and IDE or ultra editor to create Java applications or blog posts.
* I'm changing Java systax for Tritium, Uranium, Javascript, markdown and Sass.
* I'm getting use to using GitHub for pushing my code and also pushing my entire blog.
* And, finally I'm using Heroku to host this blog that you are reading right now 

So yeah, this is one of my new hacking projects....
